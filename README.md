# go

## My golang scripts repo

### hello_world

The first script is called `hello_world` as is customary in the world of programming.

`package main` is a special package that will make the code compile to an executable.

`fmt` is for format

then we define a function with `func`

then we call the Println from the `fmt` package

### data types

Go is strong typed, we need to declare the type before variable assignment.
